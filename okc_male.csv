In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

I’m not a monster but i like coriander!  I’ll never understand how and why my MBTI is important to you but I’m an INFJ-T. (the test-retest chrobach alpha averages at about .64 🥴) Also if you're ENFP or ENTP, we can be BFF.  Stop saying you want hoodies! I’ll be cold too if I give you mine!  I’m trying to find the limit for this self summary. How much can I actually write?  OKC says the more info I put = higher chances of getting a match? But what if I write my autobiography here will I be OKC times top seller or best author? 🙃  Try this! Next time when you’re commuting, don’t use your phone and observe the people in the bus/train. 99% of the time you’ll see 95% of the sample using their phones!  Idk if you’re still reading up till here I guess I’ll have to share something more personal with you since you put in so much time and effort reading my bio!  I prefer calls but it seems like people prefer texting over phone calls. Why? Maybe the preference over call is to justify my poor texting skills. Honestly, who knows?  I think there’s actually a limit to how much I can write!! I’m starting to see the ‘save’ button.  Yeap I’m certain I’ve reach the end so thank you for reading and all the best in your swiping endeavours! Please swipe right on me if you’re attractive heheheh thanks 🙃  Oh no wait I was wrong I can still scroll more. Okay now I really need to rack my brain to see what I can add.  Hmm.............  Covid is not ending soon so if you need someone to talk to, call me @ 1777 remember if it’s not an emergency call 1-777 not 995! If anyone picks up I’m not responsible!!!! But you could always drop me a message and ask me for my contact!  Okay so some things I do in my free time are: Run/Read/Eat/Sleep and consume an unhealthy amount of social media. 😶  Oh my I think there’s really no limit to how much I can write I keep pressing enter and it just keep giving me more lines to write but tbh, I’m getting tired already so if I made you smile, do consider to like share and subscribe!! Nope jk a right swipe would be great!!!! Love you ❤️  one last thing to add is that my favourite quote atm is '爱不是谁够努力就值得被珍惜’ to my non Chinese reading friends, it means ‘love is not about how much effort you put in before it’s cherished’  I should write a book someday! but today's not the day. that's all folks!  Also why is uni so stressful? and boring?  Please don’t be shy to drop a text first. A simple hi is enough I know it’s not easy starting a conversation. (cancel this, a simple hi is NOT enough)  update 1: after a few weeks with this long ass bio I think It's save to say that yes, I do get more intros on OKC! thank you to those who wrote! I'm sorry if I haven't seen all yet cause honestly there's really too much fishes in the sea. If I'm going to swipe all, i might just delay one semester and make swiping my full time job. JK I have a life but then again writing this much on OKC might infer otherwise.  Additionally, the immense amount of people complaining about the 50 words limit is not reading my bio but that's not my loss is it? Hmmmm....🤔  just realise this can be a personal diary I doubt people will have the time and patience to read through all this crap. anyways since you're already here please feel free to follow my instagram @greg.c200. I'll admit seeing higher number of followers do validate me a little HAHAHAHHA but don't act like you don't care @(those people who literally put your IG handle within the first line) no hate, you do you, me do me.  Don't ask me if I believe in horoscope! I am not going to let the alignment of the starts dictate my life and emotions. but for all the promiscuous girls out there who wishes to copulate with all the horoscopes at least once, I'm a Capricorn!  Shrek is probably one the better few dreamwork movies! LOVE IT! (correction: it is THE best)  leaving the best part for the last! if you actually read the bio, drop me an intro and say unicorn, I'll buy you a bottle of Dasani! (this is not guaranteed, don't sue me) Just want you to stay hydrated after all this reading!  and what the flying (inset your choice of word here) does it mean by 'I don't bite?!' hello girl, r u a cannibal?!  and last but not least (for now), just here for a good time, at least for the time-being. down for anything, FWB/ONS/supper buddy/friends/enemies/lovers/anything  update 2: I am writing this at 3:23am so please dont mind me! just feel like writing something. why is it that nowadays people don't want to date exclusively? I see the upside of not wanting it but I think it's doing more harm than good to society at this moment. Everyone's out here to try a little bit of everything and by the time we get back to what we actually like, it might not be there already or it just doesn't feel the same anymore. This is bad and I dont like where the trajectory of this whole online dating app is going but nonetheless if yall are here for whatever reason, I hope you find your reason.  update 3: 2021 is coming to an end so if there are things you have not done I think now is about the right time to start them! Unless it's assignments, then just leave it to the last minute. Haven't had a hangover in a really really really really long time and wow I hate this feeling.  update 4: okay is 2022 now, how's everyone new year resolution(s) coming along? do people still use OKC? As of writing this, if you are looking for something in particular, please let me know so I know how to reciprocate. I am quite tired of small talks atm, thanks  update 5: school don't teach you how to deal with the stress that comes with job application. feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! I'm convinced that as the year past and the newer generations gets shorter and shorter attention, nobody reads until here anymore. if you do, I'll make 3 predictions 1. you are fucking bored and really looking for something to do 2. you must be unattractive since you don't get much matches and you keep telling yourself that is the character that matters not the looks. well sorry, that's not how the world works, at least in todays' society. (I know cause the past few intros I get are all from people I don't deem attractive) 3. you are not 20 and below.  Cheers! you may continue swiping now",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE

7153,Ming,22,"Run with me to places with good food.  I have no idea of what to put to hit the fifty words. So here is the history usage of the word Summary.  The English noun summary comes straight from the Latin neuter noun summārium “abridgment, abstract, epitome,” an extremely rare word used only once in the surviving Latin literature by the Roman author, tragedian, statesman, and Stoic philosopher Seneca (the Younger) in one of his Moral Letters to Lucilius (39), in which he complains “…what is now commonly called a ‘breviary’ [ breviārium ] was called, in the good old days, when we used to speak Latin, a ‘summary’ [ summārium ]."" (Complaints about the terrible state of the language are nothing new.) Summārium is a compound of adjective summus “highest, topmost, top” and the noun suffix -ārium. ( Summa, the feminine of summus used as a noun, in mathematics and accounting means “sum, total”: The Romans added their numbers from the bottom up and wrote the total in summā “on the top.”) Medieval Latin has the adjective summārius “abbreviated, summary,” which was borrowed into Middle English in the 15th century.The adjectival meaning “relating to legal proceedings conducted without certain required formalities” is recorded about 1765, though the corresponding meaning of the adverb summarily appears much earlier.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE
